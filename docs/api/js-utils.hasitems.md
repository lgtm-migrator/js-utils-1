## hasItems() function

Test if a value is an array with some items (length &gt; 0).

This is not a general replacement for `.length > 0`<!-- -->, since it is also a typeguard: `if (hasItems(val)) else { val }` will complain that `val` is `never` in the `else` branch, since it was proven not to be an array by this function, even if `val` is simply empty.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function hasItems<T>(val: Maybe<Array<T>>): val is Array<T>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  val | [Maybe](./js-utils.maybe.md)<!-- -->&lt;Array&lt;T&gt;&gt; |  |

<b>Returns:</b>

val is Array&lt;T&gt;
